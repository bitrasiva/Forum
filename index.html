        <h3>Thread 1</h3>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction.</p>

        <h3>Thread 2</h3>
        <p>AI is a broad field that encompasses various subfields, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and more. AI can be categorized as either narrow AI or general AI. Narrow AI, also known as weak AI, is designed to perform a narrow task, such as language translation or driving a car. General AI, also known as strong AI or AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), would have the ability to understand, learn, and apply its intelligence across a range of tasks, similar to human intelligence.</p>

        <h3>Meta Verse</h3>
        <p>The metaverse is a collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual reality. This concept is often used to refer to a future iteration of the internet, made up of persistent, shared, 3D virtual spaces linked into a perceived virtual universe. In the metaverse, users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users, through the use of virtual reality (VR) headsets, augmented reality (AR) glasses, and other interfaces.</p>
